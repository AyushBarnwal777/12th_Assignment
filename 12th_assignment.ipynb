    "Q1. A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and management. Databases are used in various applications and systems to store, organize, and manipulate data. They provide a means for data consistency, integrity, and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of databases: SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL). Here's a brief differentiation between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "Structured Query Language (SQL): SQL is a standard language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It provides a set of commands for querying and updating data, defining and modifying the structure of the database (schemas), and ensuring data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational Model: SQL databases are based on the relational model, which organizes data into tables with rows and columns. Relationships between tables are established using keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema: SQL databases have a predefined schema that defines the structure of the data. Changes to the schema often require careful planning and may impact existing applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID Properties: SQL databases follow the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring that transactions are processed reliably even in the event of system failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "Not Only SQL (NoSQL): NoSQL databases are designed to handle a variety of data models and are not limited to the tabular structures of SQL databases. They are more flexible and can handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Models: NoSQL databases support various data models, including document-oriented, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, and graph databases. Each model is suited for different types of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema-less: NoSQL databases are often schema-less or have a dynamic schema, allowing for more flexibility in handling diverse data types. Changes to the data structure can be made without affecting existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are generally more scalable, both horizontally and vertically, making it easier to handle large amounts of data and traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "CAP Theorem: NoSQL databases are often designed with consideration to the CAP theorem, which states that it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: MongoDB (document-oriented), Cassandra (wide-column store), Redis (key-value), Neo4j (graph)."

    "\n",
    "DDL, or Data Definition Language, is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that deals with the definition and management of database structures. It includes commands for creating, modifying, and deleting database objects such as tables, indexes, and views. DDL is concerned with the structure of the database rather than the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are explanations for some key DDL commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Used to create new database objects, such as tables, indexes, or views.\n",
    "Example:\n",

    "Copy code\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    emp_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    emp_salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "This example creates a table named \"employees\" with columns for employee ID, name, and salary.\n",
    "DROP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Used to delete existing database objects, such as tables or indexes.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "This example deletes the \"employees\" table from the database.\n",
    "ALTER:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as adding or deleting columns in a table.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "ADD COLUMN emp_department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "This example adds a new column named \"emp_department\" to the \"employees\" table.\n",
    "TRUNCATE:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Used to remove all rows from a table, but retains the table structure for further use.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "This example removes all rows from the \"employees\" table, effectively emptying the table while keeping its structure intact.\n",
    "These DDL commands are powerful tools for database administrators and developers to define, modify, and manage the structure of a database. They are crucial for maintaining the integrity and organization of the database schema. It's important to use these commands with care, especially when altering or dropping database objects, as they can have a significant impact on the data and the overall database structure."

DML commands are used to insert, update, and delete data within database tables. Unlike DDL, which focuses on the structure of the database, DML focuses on the content of the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are explanations for some key DML commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT:\n",

    "Copy code\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, emp_name, emp_salary)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 50000);\n",
    "This example inserts a new record into the \"employees\" table with values for employee ID, name, and salary.\n",
    "UPDATE:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Used to modify existing records in a table based on a specified condition.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "UPDATE employees\n",
    "SET emp_salary = 55000\n",

    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "DELETE FROM employees\n",
    "WHERE emp_id = 1;\n",
    "This example deletes the record of the employee with ID 1 from the \"employees\" table.\n",
    "These DML commands are essential for managing the data within a database. They allow for the insertion of new data, updating existing records, and deleting unwanted data. It's important to use caution, especially with the UPDATE and DELETE commands, as they can modify or remove multiple records based on the specified conditions."

    "Q5. A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a relational database table. It uniquely identifies each row or record in the table, and no two rows can have the same primary key value. The primary key enforces entity integrity by ensuring that each record in the table is uniquely identifiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of a primary key:\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column must be unique across all rows in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-null: A primary key column cannot have a NULL value, meaning every record must have a valid and unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable: Once a primary key value is assigned to a record, it should not be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Used for Referential Integrity: Primary keys are often used as references by foreign keys in other tables to establish relationships between tables.\n",

It establishes a link or relationship between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table. The table containing the foreign key is called the referencing table, while the table being referenced is the referenced table.\n",

    "Can Be Null: While it's common for foreign keys to contain values that match a primary key, they can also be NULL if the relationship is optional.\n",
